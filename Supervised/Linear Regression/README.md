>Looks at scatter of data points, and finds best fit line

>If data is completely random, it is harder to find best-fit. Not useful for linear regression

>Therefore we use it when there is a strong correlation.

How it is used in predicting:
Y = mx + c
The Y is the predictive value
>The best-fit line is in a multidimensional space since we have multiple attributes
