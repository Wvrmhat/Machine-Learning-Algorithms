# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Works by creating a "Hyperplane". A hyperplane divides data by using anything that is linear.
> Hyperplane = distance between two closest points from the OPPOSITE class, distance between them and common line is the same.

Therefore we can generate an infinite amount of hyperplanes, but we must find the best
